A token to crowdsource and sell (financial) research (insights?).
}

CrunchDAO is a research team of data scientists leveraging the power of collective intelligence and Web3 to produce and sell next-generation predictive financial insights. The community seeks profit from patterns in the stock market, using a democratic reward-driven tournament model to produce and sell trading signals that generate returns, regardless of market conditions, to top-tier investment firms and hedge funds.

The CrunchDAO tournament brings decentralized scientific innovation (DeSci) to the world of finance. Over 2,000 data scientists and 400 PHDs compete to accurately predict the stock market, earning rewards for their predictions based on the performance of live financial data.

\section{A. Predicting the Market: a community led research framework}

CrunchDAO uses a community led research approach to predict the stock market.

The community:

- Collects signals from all over the world,

- Collects predictions from the CrunchDAO Tournament

- Ensemble all predictions and signal in one Meta Model

- Optimize the Meta Model

All these steps are supported by a Decentralized Science Platform to build knowledge incrementally.
